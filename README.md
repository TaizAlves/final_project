## Project
This is my final project for [Harvard CS50x course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/). It´s called "Hatural Healing". At the site it´s possible to buy some products and, also, to ready some recipes and include one of your own.

### Description
There are some pages that´s  only possible to access if you are logged in, such as add recipe, buy product and check your list of products "bought".

I included an "internal access" , so the company can add new products and check the sales. You may access these pages with:

email: n@natural.com

password: 1111

- [x] Register
